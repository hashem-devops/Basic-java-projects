# Basic Java Projects (If Statements Practice)

This repository contains simple Java programs I’ve written to practice using if statements and basic conditional logic.
Each file is a standalone program that performs a specific task based on user input or set conditions.

# Projects in This Repository

ElectricityBillCalculator.java: Calculates the total electricity bill based on the number of units used.

GradeChecker.java: Determines a student’s grade (A, B, C, etc.) based on their score.

LeapYearChecker.java: Checks if a given year is a leap year or not.

SimpleCalculator.java: Performs simple arithmetic operations using if statements.

SimpleJavaCalculator.java: Another calculator example focusing on decision-making using if conditions.

TemperatureChecker.java: Checks the temperature and prints messages like “Cold,” “Warm,” or “Hot.”

# What I’m Practicing
Writing and nesting if / else if / else statements
Handling simple user input
Using comparison and logical operators
Organizing code in the main method
Basic output formatting with System.out.println()
